                    activities organised in colleges and all students focused on that. With the changing trend we have
                    noticed a major difference in the field of academics too. Students don’t want to be bookworms; they
                    look for other options that could help them in the future. Besides, this in this high tech world,
                    every student wants to acquire knowledge in every field to stay updated. Co-circular activities play
                    a vital role in the life of students, read on to know how. Extracurricular activities increase
                    opportunities for social interaction and new relationship development. As most of these activities
                    are group-oriented which have students from different niches, which gives them a chance to more know
                    about people of different passions and cultures. Besides, this they can also find clubs or groups
                    that share similar social, religious or even entertainment interest for socialization. Interaction
                    with people of different backgrounds helps in development of interpersonal skills of students.
                    Extracurricular activities teach students how to work for a common goal and this ultimately develops
                    a sense of responsibility in them. It increases the level of confidence and also teaches them how to
                    co-operate and work with people in different conditions. They learn to face the challenges that come
                    in education and career. Extracurricular activities like sports require a person to remain
                    physically fit. Thus students have to be particular about their health and diet. They have to take
                    diet which can make them physically stronger and also do exercise daily. They start loving their
                    body, which is very important for a happier life. Most of the employers love to hire people who are
                    all rounded. Sustained involvement in more than one activity reflects the talent and potential of
                    the student. Hiring officials look for these talents in people. Besides, this when applying for
                    admission in colleges for higher degrees, these students get a preference too. While pursuing these
                    activities in college along with education students learn prioritization and time management skills
                    too. These academically and co-circularly talented students have well-groomed personality, which
                    helps them to face the world in a better way.</p>
